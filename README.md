# instantdb-server

Unofficial port of [@instantdb/react](https://github.com/instantdb/instant/blob/main/client/packages/react/README.md) for use in a reactive server

## !!!DISCLAIMER!!!

This package is an experiment. It bends the sdk to use it for something it's not supposed to do. It's very easy (if not granted) to generate unexpected behaviour and do something stupid with it.

It is also a good way for me to try think with a different perspective, so maybe you can enjoy it too. Have fun.

> warning! the library and its use will change on new versions while I explore different ways to use instant on the server

> see `sandbox/node-server/src/index.ts` for an example

- using `@preact/signals-core` for reactivity
- starting from the simple assumption that network status is always connected and no data gets stored on the server
- use it like the react sdk. everything returns signals

Related: [this](https://github.com/Dorilama/instantdb-vue#readme) is library that brings the sdk for vue.
